### Introduction

Iterative Closest Point (ICP) is one of the variants to implement scan matching on two pointclouds which are aligned at an angle and we want to overlap them. The algorithm find the transformation between a point cloud and some reference surface (or another point cloud), by minimizing the square errors between the corresponding entities.

### Theory Behind the Optimization:



### Different Implementation:

The fowllowing implementations are done to review the performance:
* CPU Naive Implementation
* GPU Naive Implementation
* KD Tree Implmentation in GPU
